The teacheR book is an introduction to the R programming language. It covers the fundamentals of R from a beginner to intermediate level. For a more applied view of R, I'm also developing another book called opeRate. This looks more specifically at performing data analysis, programming, and modelling in R.

The book is currently a work in progress, so any feedback is much appreciated and can be submitted by raising a GitHub issue.

The book is currently hosted [here](http://teacher.arawles.co.uk)
