# Overview
A collection of training materials for an introduction to the R statistical computing programming language. This is aimed at beginners, with the modules being fairly short.

For more in-depth explanations and descriptions, I'll often refer to other training materials or documentation that will explain things at a greater level.

Alongside each module is a Xaringan presentation. This can help for those looking to learn, but can also function as a first step for those looking to begin teaching R but who don't have the time to fully develop their own training modules.
Hopefully, all the topics covered in the text version will be covered in the presentation and vice versa, so if you learn visually then you can rest easy knowing that you're not missing out!
