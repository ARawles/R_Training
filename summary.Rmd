# Summary

Overall, I hope that this book has helped you grasp the basics of the R programming language. If you're a student, then I hope this was pitched at the correct level to challenge you. If you're a teacher, then I hope this book helped round out your knowledge of R such that you would feel comfortable imparting your knowledge onto those that want to hear it.

If you feel that there are improvements to be made to the content or how it was taught, then please do let me know via a [GitHub issue on the teacheR](https://github.com/ARawles/teacheR/issues) repository.

## opeRate

To help you learn how to apply the skills and understanding you've acquired through this book, I've developed a second book, [opeRate](https://operate.arawles.co.uk). opeRate was developed in exactly the same way as teacheR, but focuses on applied data analysis and practical learning. If you're interested in applying your knowledge, then I would recommend giving it a read.
